## Discription:
This is a web application that I have created that acts as a fully functioning hangman game.

## Installation:
In order to use this application you have to ensure that Node.js runtime is installed on your machine. If you don't have it installed aleady you can install it form [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Once Node.js runtime is installed ,you can download all the following files to a directory of your choice. Once all the files have been dowloaded you can open the directory within an IDE of your choice. Open a new terminal within your IDE and navigate to the directory you have downloaded the files to. Once in the directory, run `npm install` in order to download and install necessary files like node_modules. The download may take some time. After everything has been downloaded you can move on to the next step below.

## Usage: 
After everything has been downloaded you can now run the `npm start` command on your computer. A new window should open up by itself within your browser if not, open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000. You should now be able to play the game! Any changes made to files should automatically update your view within the browser after a save.


## Play now:
You can play the game right now by clicking on [this link](https://morning-springs-53131.herokuapp.com) as I have deployed this web app on [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com)


## Get help
Head over to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) if you get stuck with anything. There is a ton of information there regarding React. If you need more help on how to play the game there is a Help button available explaining the rules of the game to you.

## Enjoy
There are a plethora of words to guess in this game. I hope you have fun and enjoy!
